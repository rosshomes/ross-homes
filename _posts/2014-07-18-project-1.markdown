  - Private Sale.
  - Looking for a great location? Flat section? An investment property? Then this is the house for you.
  - An older style house situated close to the beach. There is a heat pump and fire, 3 generous size bedrooms, a lounge and dining room, separate laundry and a small conservatory area that leads out to a sunny decked area.

  - The section is flat and fully closed in, with a new fence on one boundary. A single garage and tar sealed area at the front of the section provides generous off street parking.

  - The property has had a partial re-roof, some maintenance done on the storm water drainage, and the water main replaced to the street. A total electrical re-wire was completed in 2011. The exterior and interior have both been painted within the past 2 years.

  - This house has been used as a rental, so a good investment opportunity. Alternatively suitable for a young couple starting out who are ready to add their own personal touches.
